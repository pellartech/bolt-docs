# Introduction

Welcome to the **Bolt SDK** documentation. This SDK allows developers to interact with the Bolt API seamlessly, enabling you to integrate blockchain functionalities into your applications without dealing directly with low-level API calls.

## What is Bolt?

Bolt is a powerful API that simplifies blockchain interactions, providing endpoints for managing accounts, users, transactions, tokens, contracts, and more. The SDK wraps these endpoints into easy-to-use functions, streamlining the development process.

## Key Features

- **Accounts Management**: Create and manage blockchain accounts.
- **User Management**: Handle user data and associations.
- **Transactions**: Fetch transaction details and histories.
- **Tokens**: Mint, transfer, and manage tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155).
- **Contracts**: Deploy and interact with smart contracts.
- **Executions**: Execute contract functions and monitor execution statuses.
- **Organisations**: Manage organisational data and configurations.
- **Authentication**: Secure API interactions with API keys and sessions.

## Getting Started
